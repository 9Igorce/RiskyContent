If theres any hope for what was plug.dj, either by a clone or a theme, it will live on somehow. 
Anyway, heres just some of the assets I collected from Plug.DJ for theme makers and developers with no artists. 

#IP Owners
PlugDJ/Radiant, if y'all truly believe that something as small as a theme based on your assets, or something as full blown as a site with your assets hurts a dead site, you can send DMCA notices to ghost@ghosted.me (preferred) or GitHub (https://help.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy/) which could hurt us.
